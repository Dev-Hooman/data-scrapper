# Data Scraper GUI Application

The Data Scraper GUI Application is a tool that allows users to fetch and scrape data from either an API or a web page. It provides a user-friendly interface to input the source, URL, and desired output format (JSON or CSV) for the scraped data. The application is built using the Python `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface, and it uses `requests` for making HTTP requests, `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping, and `pandas` for handling data.
